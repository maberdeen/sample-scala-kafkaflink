Standalone/general Kafka/Flink consumer in Scala

This is something I was using to learn a bit more about Scala and SBT.  The main goal was to create a standalone, generic Kafka consumer with Flink that could be used for development/testing without having to stand up a complete stack of various technologies.  This small app needs only Scala, SBT, and a default Kafka installation (with Zookeeper, that is).

You'll notice there's a couple of artifacts from https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/blob/master/02-sbt/README.md which I was following when playing more with SBT - I'll leave that here just for the sake of being lazy.
